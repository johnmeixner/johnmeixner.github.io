# About
I'm an assistant professor of law at the University of Georgia School of Law. My research focuses on how legal decisionmakers respond when confronted with complex evidence, and how our understanding of their decisions should shape policy. I study that topic primarily within the domains of criminal law, evidence, and law & neuroscience. Most of my work is empirical, and informed by my background as a psychologist.

Before becoming a professor, I spent about six years as a federal prosecutor in Detroit, where I led over 100 grand jury investigations, briefed and argued dozens of appeals before the Sixth Circuit, and first-chaired multiple jury trials. I also  worked closely with my office’s “Restart” program, designed to provide alternatives to incarceration and make criminal justice more equitable. That experience heavily informs my research, which seeks practical ways to reform the crimianl justice system, especially in sentencing.
